# SNOWBOARD / SKI GAME

## Overview

There will be multiple mini-games/stories in this game. (more to come)

## Game Structure

### 1. Basic Story

- **Mountain Selection**:

  - You have a set amount of mountains to choose from (all from real locations).
  - Some mountains will be locked since they are more advanced and require more skills.

- **Run Selection**:

  - In a selected mountain, you will choose from different runs across the mountain.
  - The interface will resemble the mountain selection, zooming in on the mountain and focusing on the runs.
  - You will start with the easy runs (bunny slopes and greens). Each acts at its own level.

- **Scoring**:

  - You will receive 1-3 stars based on:
    - Time completed
    - Other skiers/snowboarders hit
    - Other obstacles hit
  - There may be jumps, but you will not receive benefits for them.
  - After receiving 1 or more stars, you can move onto the next run.
  - Once you complete the mountain, you can move onto the next mountain.

- **End Screen**:
  - After you win/lose a run, the end screen will show:
    - Amount of stars won in the middle
    - Your time for the run right under
    - A "Play Again" button
    - A "Next Run" button (or "Back to Map" if last run on mountain)
    - A "Back to Map" button
  - The background will feature your skier, either celebrating at the end of the run or falling in the snow if you lost.

### 2. Theme and Home Screen

- **Color Scheme**:

  - The theme will reflect the colors of a snowy mountain: blue, white, and maybe some green.

- **Home Screen Design**:
  - The home screen will have a mountain in the background.
  - A 3D, animated skier will float in the middle of the screen, spinning slowly.
- **Customization**:
  - If you click on this skier, you can customize your character with different clothes, skis, and helmets, etc.
  - You will earn different customizations by earning stars, and with those stars, you will spin a wheel.
- **Wheel for Rewards**:

  - The wheel will be at the bottom of the page with the text, "Spin for Reward."
  - Above the skier, the number of runs you have successfully completed will be displayed.
  - Under the skier, there will be an "Explore" button in a cartoonish rectangle box, showing the map of the mountains to choose and play.

- **Design Consistency**:
  - All buttons and graphics will be colors that blend well with the snowy background, using complementary colors.

## Additional Comments

- How is the player controlled?
  - Arrow keys?
  - Tilting the screen on mobile?
  - The mouse?
- Without tangible aesthetics, the vision is a little unclear.
- The concept seems very similar to Grand Mountain Adventure.
- Maybe there can be a global leaderboard to make it more competitive.
- Love the gambling element
